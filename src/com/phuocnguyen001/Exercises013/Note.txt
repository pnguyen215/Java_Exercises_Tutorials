Naive String Matches string matching algorithm
an ancient string matching algorithm but almost all other methods are based on it like KMP algorithm, ... This is a thought-based algorithm that compares linearity so its complexity is O (n m) * m) quite large compared to KMP is O (n)


Example: 


Position: 2
Position: 6
Position: 12
