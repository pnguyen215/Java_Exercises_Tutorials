throwing ArithmeticException with the message is "not divided by 0".
- Method multiply to perform multiplication a * b. If the value of a and b is outside
range [-1000, 1000] then throw the NumberOutOfRangeException exception with the message
The message "So far outside of Vietnam". NumberOutOfRangeException is one
Student-defined exception.
- Write the main function to recheck the Calculator class functions, handle exceptions
